# Copilot Safety Instructions for the11-dev Project

## Overview
These instructions ensure safe, non-destructive development on the `sow-latest` branch. Treat `sow-latest` as your "last straw" safe haven—never modify it directly. Always work on isolated branches to avoid fucking up the stable version.

## Core Rules
1. **Protect `sow-latest`**: This branch is your go-to stable state. Push it regularly (`git push origin sow-latest`) to back it up on GitHub. If shit goes wrong, reset to it with `git checkout sow-latest && git reset --hard origin/sow-latest`.

2. **Work on Dev Branches Only**:
   - Create new branches from `sow-latest`: `git checkout -b dev/your-feature`.
   - Do all edits, commits, and testing here.
   - Push dev branches: `git push origin dev/your-feature`.
   - Only merge back to `sow-latest` after thorough testing.

3. **Commit Frequently**:
   - Before switching branches: `git add . && git commit -m "WIP: [description]"`.
   - If mid-change: `git stash` to save, switch, then `git stash pop`.

4. **Merge Safely**:
   - From dev branch: `git checkout sow-latest && git merge dev/your-feature`.
   - Resolve conflicts carefully—keep the stable parts.
   - Push merged `sow-latest`: `git push origin sow-latest`.

5. **Avoid Destructive Actions**:
   - No `git push --force` on `sow-latest`.
   - No direct edits to `sow-latest`—always branch first.
   - If you break a dev branch, abandon it and start fresh from `sow-latest`.

6. **Backup Milestones**:
   - Tag stable points: `git tag v1.0-safe && git push origin --tags`.
   - Create backup branches: `git checkout -b backup-before-risky-change`.

7. **Testing & Validation**:
   - Run the app (`npm run dev`) after changes.
   - Check for errors in terminal/logs.
   - If it breaks, switch back to `sow-latest` immediately.

## Workflow Reminder
- Stable: `sow-latest` (pushed, tagged).
- Work: `dev/*` branches (isolated, tested, then merged).
- Emergency: Always fall back to `sow-latest`.

Follow these to keep development safe and productive. If unsure, ask or create a new dev branch.
